📘 MICROSOFT FABRIC – Get Started with Microsoft Fabric

This folder documents my hands‑on journey through Microsoft Learn as I explore Microsoft Fabric — Microsoft’s unified analytics platform designed for modern data engineering.

Think of Microsoft Fabric as an all‑in‑one toolbox for working with data.

Instead of using many separate tools to collect, clean, store, analyze, and visualize data, Fabric puts everything in one place.

With Fabric, you can:

- Bring data in from different sources
  
- Store it safely
  
- Clean and organize it
  
- Analyze it with powerful tools
  
- Build reports and dashboards
  
- Even work with real‑time data
  
It’s designed to make data work easier, even for beginners.


🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

This folder supports my learning in:
- End‑to‑end analytics: How data moves from raw form to useful insights.
  
- Lakehouses: A modern way to store data so it’s flexible and easy to analyze.
  
- Apache Spark: A tool that helps process large amounts of data quickly.
  
- Delta Lake tables: A smarter way to store data so it’s reliable and easy to update.
  
- Dataflows Gen2: A visual tool for bringing data in and cleaning it up.
  
- Data warehouses: A structured place to store data for reporting.
  
- Real‑time intelligence: How to work with data that updates every second.
  
- Data science basics: Using notebooks and models to explore and predict with data.
  
- Fabric administration: How to manage workspaces, permissions, and settings.
  
- Pipelines: Automating data tasks so they run on their own.

    🙏 Acknowledgement

     I want to express my appreciation to a friend who generously provided temporary access to their Microsoft Fabric environment, 
     allowing me to complete the hands-on components of this Data Challenge.

     Their support made it possible for me to practice real Fabric workloads and complete the Microsoft Learn exercises included in this repository.

     Please note:

     Some screenshots and PySpark outputs may display their username as part of the Fabric workspace environment.

     This reflects the environment in which the exercises were completed.
