📘 MICROSOFT FABRIC – Ingest Data with Microsoft Fabric 

This folder contains my work for the Ingest Data with Microsoft Fabric learning path. 
It’s part of my training at the Poshem Technologies Institute DataChallenge, 
where I am learning how data is brought into Microsoft Fabric and prepared for analysis.

“Ingesting data” means bringing data from one place into another — like loading a file, pulling information from a database, or streaming live data.
Microsoft Fabric provides tools that make this process easier, faster, and more organized.
In this learning path, I explored four main ways to bring data into Fabric.


🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Ingest Data with Dataflows Gen2

   A visual, no‑code way to bring in and clean data using Power Query Online.

3. Orchestrate Processes and Data Movement

   Learn how to automate data tasks using pipelines — like setting up a machine that runs your data jobs for you.

5. Use Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric

   Spark helps process large amounts of data quickly. I used notebooks to explore and transform data.

7. Work with Real‑Time Data in an Eventhouse

   Learn how to handle data that updates every second, such as live events or streaming information.



LEARNING PROGRESS

This folder includes screenshots of:
- Completed Microsoft Learn modules
  
- Hands‑on labs
  
- PySpark results

These show my progress through the full learning path.

    🙏 Acknowledgement

     I want to express my appreciation to a friend who generously provided temporary access to their Microsoft Fabric environment, 
     allowing me to complete the hands-on components of this Data Challenge.

     Their support made it possible for me to practice real Fabric workloads and complete the Microsoft Learn exercises included in this repository.

     Please note:

     Some screenshots and PySpark outputs may display their username as part of the Fabric workspace environment.

     This reflects the environment in which the exercises were completed.
