    🙏 Acknowledgement

     I want to express my appreciation to a friend who generously provided temporary access to their Microsoft Fabric environment, 
     allowing me to complete the hands-on components of this Data Challenge.

     Their support made it possible for me to practice real Fabric workloads and complete the Microsoft Learn exercises included in this repository.

     Please note:

     Some screenshots and PySpark outputs may display their username as part of the Fabric workspace environment.

     This reflects the environment in which the exercises were completed.
