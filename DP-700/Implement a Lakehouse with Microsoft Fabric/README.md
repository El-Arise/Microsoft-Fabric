📘 MICROSOFT FABRIC – Implement a Lakehouse with Microsoft Fabric 

This folder contains my work for the Implement a Lakehouse with Microsoft Fabric learning path. 
It’s part of my training at the Poshem Technologies Institute DataChallenge, 
where I am learning how modern data systems are built using Microsoft Fabric.

 What Is a “Lakehouse”?
A lakehouse is a modern way of storing and organizing data.

    Think of it like this:
    - A data lake is a giant storage room where you can dump all kinds of data.
    - A data warehouse is a neatly organized library where everything is structured and easy to query.

    A lakehouse combines both ideas:
    - You can store any kind of data (like a lake).
    - You can organize and analyze it efficiently (like a warehouse).

Microsoft Fabric provides tools that make building and managing a lakehouse much easier.

This learning path introduces the core building blocks of a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric.

🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Introduction to End‑to‑End Analytics Using Microsoft Fabric

    A beginner‑friendly overview of how Fabric brings all data tools together in one place.

2. Get Started with Lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric

    Learn what a lakehouse is, how it works, and how Fabric helps you build one.

3. Use Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric

    Spark is a tool for processing large amounts of data. Here, I learned how to use notebooks to explore and transform data.

4. Work with Delta Lake Tables in Microsoft Fabric

    Delta tables help keep data reliable, organized, and easy to update — essential for any lakehouse.

5. Ingest Data with Dataflows Gen2

    A visual, no‑code way to bring data into the lakehouse.

6. Orchestrate Processes and Data Movement

    Learn how to automate data tasks using pipelines.

7. Organize a Fabric Lakehouse Using Medallion Architecture

    A simple method for organizing data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for better quality and analytics.

    🙏 Acknowledgement

     I want to express my appreciation to a friend who generously provided temporary access to their Microsoft Fabric environment, 
     allowing me to complete the hands-on components of this Data Challenge.

     Their support made it possible for me to practice real Fabric workloads and complete the Microsoft Learn exercises included in this repository.

     Please note:

     Some screenshots and PySpark outputs may display their username as part of the Fabric workspace environment.

     This reflects the environment in which the exercises were completed.
