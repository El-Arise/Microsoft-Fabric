📘 Microsoft Fabric – Learning Repository

Learn about Microsoft Fabric, how it works, and its applications for Data Engineering

Welcome to my Microsoft Fabric Learning Repository, created as part of the DataChallenge Program with Poshem Technologies Institute. 

This space documents my hands‑on journey through Microsoft Learn as I explore Microsoft Fabric — Microsoft’s unified analytics platform designed for modern data engineering.

This repository will include my notes, exercises, and screenshots of completed Microsoft Learn modules and labs, showcasing my progress and practical understanding of Fabric’s capabilities.

    🙏 Acknowledgement

     I want to express my appreciation to a friend who generously provided temporary access to their Microsoft Fabric environment, 
     allowing me to complete the hands-on components of this Data Challenge.

     Their support made it possible for me to practice real Fabric workloads and complete the Microsoft Learn exercises included in this repository.

     Please note:

     Some screenshots and PySpark outputs may display their username as part of the Fabric workspace environment.

     This reflects the environment in which the exercises were completed.
